A breakdown of the RSI formula reveals that its power lies in its ability to identify consistent uptrends with strong momentum.\nSome practitioners use RSI ranges to identify existing trends and RSI extremes to signal momentum shifts. However, these approaches do not quantify how long RSI should hold its range, how regularly RSI should reach a momentum milestone and,\nmost importantly, if RSI range and momentum indications have predictive value. The goal of this paper is to systematically test RSI range and momentum signals using stocks in the S&P 500. Moreover,\nthis paper will show that the RSI range alone is inadequate because it does not always capture upside momentum. The RSI range measures trend consistency well,\nbut a momentum component is needed to uncover the strongest uptrends. After quantifying and testing, this paper will provide evidence that signals combining an RSI bull range with RSI momentum can foreshadow sizable advances with good success rates.\nAs such, these signals can be part of a successful investing strategy that combines trend-following and momentum.\n",

On average, stocks deliver close to zero returns in the six month period from May through October, only giving a risk premium from November through April.\nThis effect, however, has not been widely covered in academic literature. We examine the hypothesis that the seasonal pattern is caused by an optimism cycle.\nTowards year end, investors start to look towards the new year, often with overly optimistic expectations. This results in attractive returns for stocks.\nSeveral months into the year, this initial optimism becomes hard to maintain and the stock market experiences a summer lull. A zero-investment global sector-rotation strategy based on this theory appears to be highly profitable.\nGlobal earnings growth revisions also follow a seasonal pattern parallel to that of the stock market. Finally, in a separate analysis for the US stock market, investors\u2019 optimism as measured by the initial returns on IPOs almost completely capture the results of the sector-rotation strategy.\nAll these findings support the optimism-cycle hypothesis.\n",

        "desc": "\nWe document significant \"time series momentum\" in equity index, currency, commodity, and bond futures for each of the 58 liquid instruments we consider.\nWe find persistence in returns for one to 12 months that partially reverses over longer horizons, consistent with sentiment theories of initial under-reaction and delayed over-reaction.\nA diversified portfolio of time series momentum strategies across all asset classes delivers substantial abnormal returns with little exposure to standard asset pricing factors and performs best during extreme markets.\nExamining the trading activities of speculators and hedgers, we find that speculators profit from time series momentum at the expense of hedgers.\n",

        "desc": "\nAccording to Streetlore, as embedded in the adage 'As goes January so goes the rest of the year,' the market return in January provides useful information to would-be investors in that the January market return predicts the market return over the remainder of the year.\nThis adage has become known as the January Barometer. In an earlier paper (Cooper, McConnell and Ovtchinnikov, 2006) we investigated the power of the January market return to predict returns for the next 11 months using 147 years of U.S. stock market returns.\nWe found that, on average, the 11-month holding period return following positive Januarys was significantly higher, by a wide margin, than the 11-month holding period return following negative Januarys.\nIn this paper we update that analysis through 2008 and address the question of how an investor can best use that information as part of an investment strategy.\nWe find that the best way to use the January Barometer is not the obvious one of being long following positive Januarys and short following negative Januarys, but to be long following positive Januarys and invest in t-bills following negative Januarys.\nThis strategy beats various alternatives, including a passive long-the-market-all-the-time strategy, by significant margins over the 152 years for which we have data.\n",

With the continuous development of the crypto market, researchers aimed to analyze novel cryptocurrencies thoroughly.\nAn excellent starting point might be in other recognized effects from the developed asset classes. This research examines seasonality effects such as when the major NYSE opened or closed and their intraday, overnight, or daily components.\nFurthermore, we also examine the distribution of the daily returns and the returns that are significant. The results point to a simple seasonality strategy that is based on holding BTC only for two hours per day.\nThe second aim is to examine trend-following and mean reversion strategies. The data suggests that BTC tends to trend when it is at its maximum and bounce back when at the minimum.\nThese findings support the empirical observations that BTC tends to trend strongly and revert after drawdowns.\n\n",

        "desc": "\nOver the years many commodity trading advisors, proprietary traders, and global macro hedge funds have successfully applied various trend following methods to profitably trade in global futures markets. \nVery little research, however, has been published regarding trend following strategies applied to stocks. Is it reasonable to assume that trend following works on futures but not stocks? We decided to put a long only trend following strategy to the test by running it against a comprehensive database of U.S. stocks that have been adjusted for corporate actions 1 . Delisted 2 companies were included to account for survivorship bias 3 . Realistic transaction cost estimates (slippage & commission) were applied. Liquidity filters were used to limit hypothetical trading to only stocks that would have been liquid enough to trade, at the time of the trade. Coverage included 24,000+ securities spanning 22 years. The empirical results strongly suggest that trend following on stocks does offer a positive mathematical expectancy 4 , an essential building block of an effective investing or trading system.\n\n",

The effect is very stable, both across time and asset classes.\nIt makes the existence of trends one of the most statistically significant anomalies in financial markets. When analyzing the trend following signal further, we find a clear saturation effect for large signals,\nsuggesting that fundamentalist traders do not attempt to resist \"weak trends\", but step in when their own signal becomes strong enough. Finally, we study the performance of trend following in the recent period.\nWe find no sign of a statistical degradation of long trends, whereas shorter trends have significantly withered.\n",

The annual alpha spread of global low versus high volatility decile portfolios amounts to 12% over the 1986-2006 period.\nWe also observe this volatility effect within the US, European and Japanese markets in isolation. Furthermore, we find that the volatility effect cannot be explained by other well-known effects such as value and size.\nOur results indicate that equity investors overpay for risky stocks. Possible explanations for this phenomenon include (i) leverage restrictions, (ii) inefficient two-step investment processes, and (iii) behavioral biases of private investors.\nIn order to exploit the volatility effect in practice we argue that investors should include low risk stocks as a separate asset class in the strategic asset allocation phase of their investment process.\n\n",
